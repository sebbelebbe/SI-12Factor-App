# 12 factor app. 
I will start by saying that I consider this task very hard because I find hard with the little knowledge I have about this subject to try to argue with people way more experienced than me.  

This is my reprioritzed list of the 12 factors in the 12 factor list:  

1.	Codebase. 
2.	Dependencies. 
3.	Config. 
4.	Backing services. 
5.	Logs.  
6.	Build, release, run. 
7.	Dev/prod parity.  
8.	Processes.  
9.	Port binding.  
10.	Concurrency.  
11.	Disposability.  
12.	Admin processes.  

As you can see I didnâ€™t change much for the reason mentioned In the beginning but I decidet to prioritize logs and Dev/prod.  

I decided to change logs as I beleave that the sooner the better you get this up an running as you will more knowledge about what kind of bugs that might occur.  

Dev/prod parity I have experienced my self how many problems there can be when the developing mashing and the production environment is to difference so I would prioitiest to do this a little earlyere then in the original list.
